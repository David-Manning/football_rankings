# Better Football Rankings

This project fixes a key issue with traditional football league rankings: 

Points are used as a proxy for ability but are not conditioned on whether the team was playing at home or away or who the team played, and goals scored/conceded are proxies for attacking and defensive ability but are similarly not conditioned on home or away status or opponent.
